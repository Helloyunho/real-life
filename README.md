# real-life

Repository to track some issues in my real life.

You can check [the issues page](https://github.com/Helloyunho/real-life/issues) to...
- See the issues I have to do
- Give me some suggestions to solve the issue
- Keep nagging me to do it
- Or you can even make an issue for me! ...Unless it's not mean to someone.
